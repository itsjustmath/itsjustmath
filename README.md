### Hi there 👋

I’m a New York-born and Los Angeles-raised front-end developer / UI engineer. When I’m not working, you can find me hiking, biking, reading, sipping coffee, or laughing at my own terrible puns.

- 🔭 I currently lead site builds at Accenture. Prior to that I worked on the apartment rental platform, Radpad.
- 🎨 Take a look at [my portfolio](https://itsjustmath.net/) to see some of the sites I've worked on
- 🧐 Visit my [Medium profile](https://medium.com/@itsjustmath) for some user experience case studies I've done
- 📝 Check out [my newsletter](https://itsjustmath.substack.com/) for some of my thoughts on the cross-sections between culture and technology
